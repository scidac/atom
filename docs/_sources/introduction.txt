Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars, and magnetic confinement devices, such as 
the tokamak, provide a possible path to tap this benign and inexhaustible source of energy 
here on Earth.  The behavior of the hot ionized gas, or plasma, inside a tokamak is complex, and 
varies between the extremely hot inner core region, the outer insulating region of the confined 
plasma (or *pedestal*), and the cooler unconfined plasma (or *scrape-off-layer*).

The goal of the AToM project is to support, integrate, and build upon a wide spectrum of existing 
research activities in the US fusion program, and guide the integration of high performance computing 
resources to enable a broad range of new physics capabilities.  A number of computational tools, 
including a workflow manager (OMFIT), computational framework (IPS), and high performance simulation 
codes (GYRO/CGYRO, NEO, TGYRO, COGENT), along with the research products and expertise of the FASTMath 
and SUPER SciDAC institutes, will together enable simulations of complex plasma behavior, and extensive 
validation against experimental data.  In particular, AToM will enable advanced integrated simulations 
which couple core, pedestal and scrape-off-layer physics, in order to study important interactions 
between regions of the plasma, and improve capability to predict, and further optimize, performance 
of the fusion plasma.

The AToM project focuses on seven research thrusts:

1. Maintain OMFIT+IPS frameworks, provide wrappers and streamlining

2. Create simulation workflows for the core, pedestal and scrape-off-layer

3. Develop workflows for experimental validation

4. Accelerate COGENT integration into AToM with FASTMath

5. Carry out SUPER performance engineering of xGYRO/NEO

6. Establish a data management scheme, provenance and portal services

7. Provide user support and community outreach
