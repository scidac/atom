Advanced TOkamak Modeling project
---------------------------------

The goal of the AToM project is to enhance and extend predictive modeling capabilities that currently exist within the US magnetic fusion program.
We endeavour to support -- rather than subvert -- current workflows, build essential new infrastructure to address critical modeling gaps, and guide integration of high-performance computing resources to enable new physics capabilities.
The guiding philosophy of AToM is to take a bottom-up, collaborative approach that focuses on leveraging and integrating the wide spectrum of existing research activities throughout the US fusion community.
In this way, will take the US fusion programâ€™s existing, mission-critical integrated modeling capabilities and make them even better.

The AToM project focuses on seven research thrusts:

1. Maintain OMFIT+IPS frameworks, provide wrappers and streamlining

2. Create simulation workflows for the core, pedestal and scrape-off-layer

3. Develop workflows for experimental validation

4. Accelerate COGENT integration into AToM with FASTMath

5. Carry out SUPER performance engineering of xGYRO/NEO

6. Establish a data management scheme, provenance and portal services

7. Provide user support and community outreach
