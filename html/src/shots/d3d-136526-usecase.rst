DIII-D #136526
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was part of an experiment designed to
test for the presence of kinetic ballooning modes in the pedestal
region and provide tests of the EPED1 model. A current scan
was performed during the experiment where Ip was varied from 1.0
to 1.3MA. The major plasma parameters for this discharge are 
Bt=2.1T, Ip=1.2MA, kappa=1.82, and delta(u,l)=(0.38,0.73).
