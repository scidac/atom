DIII-D #164510
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was part of an experiment designed
to develop the high beta_p scenario and attempt to maintain
qmin greater than 2. The profiles were analyzed at a time slice 
(4745ms) where the plasma current had been ramped up to 1.0MA.
While at a slightly lower beta_N (2.4), the priority was on 
having well resolved profile data. The major plasma parameters 
are Bt=2.1T, Ip=1.0MA, Pnb=8.3MW, kappa=1.8, and delta(u,l)=(0.50,0.72).
