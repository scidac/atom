DIII-D #136536
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was part of an experiment designed to
test for the presence of kinetic ballooning modes in the pedestal
region and provide tests of the EPED1 model. A current scan
was performed during the experiment where Ip was varied from 1.0
to 1.3MA. This case has 6.8MW of NB heating and compliments 
#136531 which had 4.5MW of NBI. The major plasma parameters for 
this discharge are Bt=2.1T, Ip=1.3MA, kappa=1.80, and 
delta(u,l)=(0.38,0.75).
