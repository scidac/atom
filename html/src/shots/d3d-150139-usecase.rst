DIII-D #150139
==============

Description
-----------

This L-mode discharge was part of a shortfall experiment where the
plasma current scan was varied at fixed toroidal field and plasma shape.
It was heated with 2.2W of NBI. Analysis was performed at 2.026 secs.

The major plasma parameters are Bt=1.9T, Ip=0.8MA, kappa=1.77, and
delta(u,l)=(0.67,0.31). This discharge complements the other discharges
in this series at 1.0 and 1.4MA.
