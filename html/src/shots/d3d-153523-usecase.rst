DIII-D #153523
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was run in a lower single null configuration 
with the aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity closely matched 
to what is expected for the ITER baseline inductive 
scenario (ITER-similar-shape). It was heated with 2.6MW of NBI
and 3.3MW of ECH. Analysis was performed at 3.745 secs.

The major plasma parameters are Bt=1.7T, Ip=1.3MA, kappa=1.8, and
delta(u,l)=(0.37,0.8). This discharge complements 155196 but here
there is nearly zero beam torque (0.42 Nt-m).

Data analysis
-------------

ONETWO run with 51 radial grid points. The EFIT used is EFIT04
with a 65x65 grid.
