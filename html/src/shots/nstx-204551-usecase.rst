NSTX-U #204551
==============

Description
-----------

This is a representative L-mode case from a series of L-mode
discharges where the goal was to establish and diagnose steady-state
L-mode plasmas over a range of plasma current, NBI heating, and densities.
Transport analysis was performed at 0.900 sec during 
during the sawtoothing phase and where the NBI heating was 2.6MW.
The major plasma parameters are R=0.93, a=0.59, Bt=0.63T, Ip=0.79MA, 
kappa=1.7, and delta=0.40.
