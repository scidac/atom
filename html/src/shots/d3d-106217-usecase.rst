DIII-D #106217
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was part of a scan in elongation
with the density, temperature, and toroidal field held fixed 
at both fixed q_95 and fixed I_p. This discharge is the companion
discharge to 106210 with a lower elongation. Here, the plasma
current was reduced in order to maintain the same q-profile as
in 106210. The major plasma parameters are 
Bt=1.9T, Ip=0.84MA, kappa=1.7, and delta(u,l)=(0.14,0.43).
