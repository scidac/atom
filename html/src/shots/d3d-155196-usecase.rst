DIII-D #155196
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge case was part of a study comparing ITER 
Baseline Scenario (IBS) discharges with neutral beam (NB) heating 
alone to otherwise identical discharges in which some of the 
NB power was replaced with electron cyclotron heating (ECH).
Two time slices were chosen. The first time slice at 2.20 secs includes both
NBI and ECH. The second time is at 3.0 secs and has NBI only.

The major plasma parameters are Bt=1.7T, Ip=1.3MA, kappa=1.8, and
delta(u,l)=(0.35,0.8). The first time slice at 2200ms has 3.3MW
of ECH and 2.6MW of NBI. The second time slice has only 3.5MW of NBI.
