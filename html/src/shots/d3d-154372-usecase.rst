DIII-D #154372
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was part of an experiment designed
to develop the high beta_p scenario and achieve excellent energy
confinement with relatively low NBI driven torque. The profiles were 
analyzed at 2380ms where beta_N=2.6 and the plasma had little or no 
MHD activity. The major plasma parameters are Bt=2.0T, Ip=0.6MA, Pnb=8.2MW, 
kappa=1.83, and delta(u,l)=(0.69,0.37).
