DIII-D #154406
==============

Description
-----------

This H-mode discharge was part of an experiment designed
to develop the high beta_p scenario and achieve excellent energy
confinement with relatively low NBI driven torque. This discharge
compliments 154372 which had a beta_N=2.6. The profiles for 154406 
were analyzed at 5170ms where beta_N=3.0 and includes ECH heating.
The major plasma parameters are Bt=2.0T, Ip=0.6MA, Pnb=8.3MW, Pech=3.3MW,
kappa=1.89, and delta(u,l)=(0.73,0.46).
