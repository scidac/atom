A Brief Tour of AToM 
====================

The AToM project philosophy is to **enhance and extend present modeling capabilities by leveraging and
integrating existing research**.  AToM supports numerous physics codes, frameworks, and tools which have
been developed independently by the fusion community, often through years or decades of research.  AToM
seeks to streamline the integration of these tools, to further their development, and to deploy and support
the resulting software.
