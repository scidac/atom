To *edit* webpages, edit files in the src directory.

To *build* webpages, type 'make' in this directory. 

To *publish* webpages, type 'make sync' to move generated html then 'git push' to push docs to master at GitHub. In the case where a version of Sphinx is used that hasn't been used before, the sync may need to be done without excluding '_static'.
