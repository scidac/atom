Advanced TOkamak Modeling project
---------------------------------

.. The goal of the AToM (Advanced Tokamak Modeling) project is to enhance and extend US capability to predict and optimize the performance of magnetic fusion energy systems, via a program of integrated simulation and modeling. Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars, and magnetic confinement devices, such as the tokamak, provide a possible path to tap this benign and inexhaustible source of energy here on Earth. The behavior of the hot ionized gas, or plasma, inside a tokamak is complex, and varies between the extremely hot inner core region, the outer insulating region of the confined plasma (or "pedestal"), and the cooler unconfined plasma (or "scrape-off-layer"). The AToM project will support, integrate, and build upon a wide spectrum of existing research activities in the US fusion program, and guide the integration of high performance computing resources to enable a broad range of new physics capabilities. A number of computational tools, including a workflow manager (OMFIT), computational framework (IPS), and high performance simulation codes (GYRO/TGYRO, COGENT), along with the research products and expertise of the FASTMath and SUPER SciDAC institutes, will together enable simulations of complex plasma behavior, and extensive validation against experimental data. In particular, AToM will enable advanced integrated simulations which couple core, pedestal and scrape-off-layer physics, in order to study important interactions between regions of the plasma, and improve capability to predict, and further optimize, performance of the fusion plasma.

The goal of the AToM project is to enhance and extend predictive modeling capabilities that currently exist within the US magnetic fusion program.
We endeavour to support -- rather than subvert -- current workflows, build essential new infrastructure to address critical modeling gaps, and guide integration of high-performance computing resources to enable new physics capabilities.
The guiding philosophy of AToM is to take a bottom-up, collaborative approach that focuses on leveraging and integrating the wide spectrum of existing research activities throughout the US fusion community.
In this way, will take the US fusion programâ€™s existing, mission-critical integrated modeling capabilities and make them even better.

The AToM project focuses on seven research thrusts:

1. Maintain OMFIT+IPS frameworks, provide wrappers and streamlining

2. Create simulation workflows for the core, pedestal and scrape-off-layer

3. Develop workflows for experimental validation

4. Accelerate COGENT integration into AToM with FASTMath

5. Carry out SUPER performance engineering of xGYRO/NEO

6. Establish a data management scheme, provenance and portal services

7. Provide user support and community outreach
